# Howlers
A minecraft plugin which makes wolves howl periodically. This was just a simple and fun project I did which hopefully adds some slice of life improvement into your minecraft server. The plugin essentially works by checking if the moon is a full moon and if so then at night every each `Delay` ticks the plugin will attempt to have each wolf entity it finds howl with `ChanceOfBark` probability. I think, in the future, to add some more functionality I could make it so that wolves which have an owner react differently or I could make wolves more likely to become aggressive on full moons, and more likely to spawn.
